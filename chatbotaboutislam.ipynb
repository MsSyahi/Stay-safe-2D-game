            "Islam ( ;[a] Arabic: الاسلام, romanized: al-’Islām, [ɪsˈlaːm] ()) is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion whose central text, the Quran, is considered by followers, known as Muslims,[1] to be the word of God.[2][3] It is the world's second-largest religion with more than two billion followers or 24.9% of the world's population.[4][5] Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful and unique, and has guided humanity through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs, with the Quran as the final, universal revelation and Muhammad as the seal of the prophets,[3][7] while the teachings and practices of Muhammad documented in traditional accounts provide a secondary constitutional model for Muslims to follow.[8]\n",
            "\n",
            "Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.[9] Muslims consider the Quran, in Arabic, to be the unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and the unrighteous punished in hell.[11] Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, as well as following Islamic law (sharia), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment.[13] The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.[14]\n",
            "\n",
            "From a historical point of view, Islam originated in early 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula, in Mecca.[15] and by the 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate extended from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus River in the east. The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century, during the Abbasid Caliphate, when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, economic, and cultural flourishing.[16][17][18] The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates such as the Ottoman Empire, trade, and conversion to Islam by missionary activities (dawah).[19]\n",
            "\n",
            "Most Muslims are of one of two denominations: Sunni (85–90%)[20] or Shia (10–15%),[21][22] and make up a majority of the population in 49 countries.[24][25] Sunni and Shia differences arose from disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions.[26] About 12% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country;[27] 31% live in South Asia;[28] 20% in the Middle East–North Africa and 15% in sub-Saharan Africa.[29] Sizable Muslim communities can also be found in the Americas, China, and Europe.[30][31] Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.[32][33]\n",
            "\n",
            "Etymology\n",
            "\n",
            "In Arabic, Islam (Arabic: إسلام lit. 'submission [to God]') is the verbal noun originating from the verb سلم (salama), from triliteral root س-ل-م (S-L-M), which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, sincerity, safeness, and peace.[34] Islam is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root and means \"submission\" or \"total surrender\". In a religious context, it means \"total surrender to the will of God\".[35] A Muslim (Arabic: مُسْلِم), the word for a follower of Islam, is the active participle of the same verb form, and means \"submitter (to God)\" or \"one who surrenders (to God)\". The word \"Islam\" (\"submission\") sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. Some verses stress the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: \"Whoever God wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.\"[i]\n",
            "\n",
            "Others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.[ii] In the Hadith of Gabriel, Islam is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith), and ihsān (excellence).[38]\n",
            "\n",
            "The word \"silm\" (Arabic: سِلْم) in Arabic means both peace and also the religion of Islam.[39] A common linguistic phrase demonstrating its usage is \"he entered into as-silm\" (Arabic: دَخَلَ فِي السِّلْمِ) which means \"he entered into Islam,\" with a connotation of finding peace by submitting one's will to the Will of God.[39] The word \"Islam\" can be used in a linguistic sense of submission or in a technical sense of the religion of Islam, which also is called as-silm which means peace.[39]\n",
            "\n",
            "Islam itself was historically called Mohammedanism in the English-speaking world. This term has fallen out of use and is sometimes said to be offensive, as it suggests that a human being, rather than God, is central to Muslims' religion, parallel to Buddha in Buddhism.[40] Some authors, however, continue to use the term Mohammedanism as a technical term for the religious system as opposed to the theological concept of Islam that exists within that system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Articles of faith\n",
            "\n",
            "The Islamic creed (aqidah) requires belief in six articles: God, angels, books, prophets, the Day of Resurrection and in the divine decree.\n",
            "\n",
            "God\n",
            "\n",
            "The central concept of Islam is tawḥīd (Arabic:توحيد), the oneness of God. Usually thought of as a precise monotheism, but also panentheistic in Islamic mystical teachings.[41] God is seen as incomparable and without partners such as in the Christian Trinity,[42] and associating partners to God or attributing God's attributes to others is seen as idolatory, called shirk. God is seen as transcendent of creation and so is beyond comprehension. Thus, therefore Muslims are not iconodules and do not attribute forms to God. God is instead described and referred to by several names or attributes, the most common being Ar-Rahmān (الرحمان) meaning \"The Entirely Merciful,\" and Ar-Rahīm ( الرحيم) meaning \"The Especially Merciful\" which are invoked at the beginning of most chapters of the Quran.[43][44]\n",
            "\n",
            "Islam teaches that the creation of everything in the universe was brought into being by God's command as expressed by the wording, \"Be, and it is,\"[iii][45] and that the purpose of existence is to worship God.[iv][46][47] He is viewed as a personal god[v][45] and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God. Consciousness and awareness of God is referred to as Taqwa. Allāh is a term with no plural or gender being ascribed to it and is also used by Muslims and Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews in reference to God, whereas ʾilāh (Arabic: إله) is a term used for a deity or a god in general.[48] Other non-Arab Muslims might use different names as much as Allah, for instance \"Tanrı\" in Turkish or \"Khodā\" in Persian.\n",
            "\n",
            "Angels\n",
            "\n",
            "Angels (Arabic:ملك malak) are beings described in the Quran and hadith. They are described as created to worship God and also to serve other specific duties such as communicating revelations from God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's soul at the time of death. They are described as being created variously from 'light' (nūr)[51] or 'fire' (nār)[52] Islamic angels are often represented in anthropomorphic forms combined with supernatural images, such as wings, being of great size or wearing heavenly articles.[vi][54] Common characteristics for angels are their missing needs for bodily desires, such as eating and drinking. Some of them, such as Gabriel and Michael, are mentioned by name in the Quran. Angels play a significant role in the literature about the Mi'raj, where Muhammad encounters several angels during his journey through the heavens. Further angels have often been featured in Islamic eschatology, theology and philosophy.\n",

            "\n",
            "The Islamic holy books are the records that Muslims believe various prophets received from God through revelations, called wahy. Muslims believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, such as the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel), had become distorted—either in interpretation, in text, or both,[57] while the Quran (lit. \"Recitation\")[58][59] is viewed as the final, verbatim and unaltered word of God.\n",
            "\n",
            "Muslims believe that the verses of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad by God, through the archangel Gabriel (Jibrīl), on multiple occasions between 610 CE and 632, the year Muhammad died. While Muhammad was alive, these revelations were written down by his companions, although the prime method of transmission was orally through memorization.[61] The Quran is divided into 114 chapters (suras) which combined contain 6,236 verses (āyāt). The chronologically earlier chapters, revealed at Mecca, are concerned primarily with spiritual topics while the later Medinan chapters discuss more social and legal issues relevant to the Muslim community.[45][58] Muslim jurists consult the hadith ('accounts'), or the written record of Prophet Muhammad's life, to both supplement the Quran and assist with its interpretation. The science of Quranic commentary and exegesis is known as tafsir.[62] The set of rules governing proper elocution of recitation is called tajwid. In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature,[64][65] and has influenced art and the Arabic language.[66]\n",

            "Prophets (Arabic: أنبياء, anbiyāʾ) are believed to have been chosen by God to receive and preach a divine message. Additionally, a prophet delivering a new book to a nation is called a rasul (Arabic: رسول‎, rasūl), meaning \"messenger\".[67] Muslims believe prophets are human and not divine. All of the prophets are said to have preached the same basic message of Islam – submission to the will of God – to various nations in the past and that this accounts for many similarities among religions. The Quran recounts the names of numerous figures considered prophets in Islam, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, among others.[45]\n",
            "\n",
            "Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad as the final prophet (\"Seal of the prophets\") to convey the completed message of Islam. In Islam, the \"normative\" example of Muhammad's life is called the sunnah (literally \"trodden path\"). Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's moral behaviors in their daily lives, and the Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Quran.[68] This example is preserved in traditions known as hadith, which are accounts of his words, actions, and personal characteristics. Hadith Qudsi is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as God's verbatim words quoted by Muhammad that are not part of the Quran. A hadith involves two elements: a chain of narrators, called sanad, and the actual wording, called matn. There are various methodologies to classify the authenticity of hadiths, with the commonly used grading being: \"authentic\" or \"correct\" (صحيح, ṣaḥīḥ); \"good\", hasan (حسن, ḥasan); or \"weak\" (ضعيف, ḍaʻīf), among others. The Kutub al-Sittah are a collection of six books, regarded as the most authentic reports in Sunnism. Among them is Sahih al-Bukhari, often considered by Sunnis to be one of the most authentic sources after the Quran.[69][70] Another famous source of hadiths is known as The Four Books, which Shias consider as the most authentic hadith reference.[71][72][73]\n",

            "Belief in the \"Day of Resurrection\" or Yawm al-Qiyāmah (Arabic:يوم القيامة), is also crucial for Muslims. It is believed that the time of Qiyāmah is preordained by God but unknown to man. The Quran and the hadith, as well as in the commentaries of scholars, describe the trials and tribulations preceding and during the Qiyāmah. The Quran emphasizes bodily resurrection, a break from the pre-Islamic Arabian understanding of death.[74]\n",

            "On Yawm al-Qiyāmah (Arabic: يوم القيامة), Muslims believe all humankind will be judged by their good and bad deeds and consigned to Jannah (paradise) or Jahannam (hell). The Quran in Surat al-Zalzalah describes this as: \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it. And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.\" The Quran lists several sins that can condemn a person to hell, such as disbelief in God (كفر, kufr), and dishonesty. However, the Quran makes it clear that God will forgive the sins of those who repent if he wishes. Good deeds, like charity, prayer, and compassion towards animals,[75] will be rewarded with entry to heaven. Muslims view heaven as a place of joy and blessings, with Quranic references describing its features. Mystical traditions in Islam place these heavenly delights in the context of an ecstatic awareness of God.[77] Yawm al-Qiyāmah is also identified in the Quran as Yawm ad-Dīn (Arabic:يوم الدين \"Day of Religion\");[vii] as-Sāʿah (Arabic:الساعة \"the Last Hour\");[viii] and al-Qāriʿah (Arabic:القارعة \"The Clatterer\");[ix]\n",

Al-qadar, meaning \"power\", derives from a root that means \"to measure\" or \"calculating\".[78][79] Muslims often express this belief in divine destiny with the phrase \"Insha-Allah\" meaning \"if God wills\" when speaking on future events.[80][81] In addition to loss, gain is also seen as a test of believers – whether they would still recognize that the gain originates only from God.[82]\n",

Conservative estimates of annual zakat are that it amounts to 15 times global humanitarian aid contributions.[94] Sadaqah, as opposed to Zakat, is a much encouraged supererogatory charity.[95] A waqf is a perpetual charitable trust, which financed hospitals and schools in Muslim societies.[97][98]\n",

Pilgrims spend a day and a night on the plains of Mina, then a day praying and worshipping in the plain of Mount Arafat, then spending a night on the plain of Muzdalifah; then moving to Jamarat, symbolically stoning the Devil,[100] then going to the city of Mecca and walking seven times around the Kaaba, which Muslims believe Abraham built as a place of worship, then walking seven times between Mount Safa and Mount Marwah recounting the steps of Abraham's wife, Hagar, while she was looking for water for her baby Ishmael in the desert before Mecca developed into a settlement.[101] All Muslim men should wear only two simple white unstitched pieces of cloth called ihram, intended to bring continuity through generations and uniformity among pilgrims despite class or origin.[102][103] Another form of pilgrimage, umrah, is supererogatory and can be undertaken at any time of the year.

New trade routes rapidly transformed Meccan society from a semi-bedouin society to a commercial urban society, leaving out weaker segments of society without protection. He acquired the nickname \"trustworthy\" (Arabic: الامين), and was sought after as a bank to safeguard valuables and an impartial arbitrator. Affected by the ills of society and after becoming financially secure through marrying his employer, the businesswoman Khadija, he began retreating to a cave to contemplate. During the last 22 years of his life, beginning at age 40 in 610 CE, Muhammad reported receiving revelations from God, conveyed to him through the archangel Gabriel,[107][108] thus becoming the seal of the prophets sent to the mankind according to Islamic tradition.[109][107]\n",

Many early converts to Islam were women, the poor, foreigners, and slaves like the first muezzin Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi. The Meccan elite profited from the pilgrimages to the idols of the Kaaba and felt Muhammad was destabilizing their social order by preaching about one God and that in the process he gave ideas to the poor and slaves.[110][111] Muhammad, who was accused of being a poet, a madman or possessed, presented the challenge of the Quran to imitate the like of the Quran in order to disprove him. The Meccan authorities persecuted Muhammad and his followers, including a boycott and banishment of Muhammad and his clan to starve them into withdrawing their protection of him. This resulted in the Migration to Abyssinia of some Muslims (to the Aksumite Empire).\n",

            "After 12 years of the persecution of Muslims by the Meccans, Muhammad and his companions performed the Hijra (\"emigration\") in AD 622 to the city of Yathrib (current-day Medina). There, with the Medinan converts (the Ansar) and the Meccan migrants (the Muhajirun), Muhammad in Medina established his political and religious authority. The Constitution of Medina was signed,[b] by all the tribes of Medina agreeing to defend Medina from external threats and establishing among the Muslim, Jewish, Christian, and pagan communities religious freedoms and freedom to use their own laws, security of women and the role of Medina as a sacred place barred of weapons and violence. Within a few years, two battles took place against the Meccan forces: first, the Battle of Badr in 624—a Muslim victory—and then a year later, when the Meccans returned to Medina, the Battle of Uhud, which ended inconclusively.[citation needed] The Arab tribes in the rest of Arabia then formed a confederation, and during the Battle of the Trench (March–April 627) besieged Medina, intent on finishing off Islam. In 628, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was signed between Mecca and the Muslims and was broken by Mecca two years later. After signing the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, many more people converted to Islam. At the same time, Meccan trade routes were cut off as Muhammad brought surrounding desert tribes under his control.[118] By 629 Muhammad was victorious in the nearly bloodless conquest of Mecca, and by the time of his death in 632 (at age 62) he had united the tribes of Arabia into a single religious polity.[119]\n",

The first successors – Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman ibn al-Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and sometimes Hasan ibn Ali[120] – are known in Sunni Islam as al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn (\"Rightly Guided Caliphs\"). Some tribes left Islam and rebelled under leaders who declared themselves new prophets but were crushed by Abu Bakr in the Ridda wars.[122] Under Umar, the caliphate expanded rapidly as Muslims scored major victories over the Persian and Byzantine empires.[123] Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and heretics and taxed heavily, often helped Muslims take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests. Uthman was elected in 644. Ali reluctantly accepted being elected the next Caliph after Uthman, whose assassination by rebels in 656 led to the First Civil War. Muhammad's widow, Aisha raised an army against Ali asking to avenge the death of Uthman but was defeated at the Battle of the Camel. Ali attempted to remove the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya, who was seen as corrupt. Mu'awiya then declared war on Ali after accusing Ali of being behind Uthman's death. Ali defeated him in the Battle of Siffin and then decided to arbitrate with him, which angered the Kharijites, an extremist sect who felt Mu'awiya should be fought. They felt that by not fighting a sinner, Ali became a sinner as well and they rebelled against him and were defeated in the Battle of Nahrawan but a Kharijite assassin later killed Ali and Ali's son Hasan ibn Ali was elected Caliph. To avoid further fighting, Hasan signed a peace treaty abdicating to Mu'awiyah in return for him not appointing a successor. Mu'awiyah began the Umayyad dynasty with the appointment of his son Yazid I and this sparked the Second Civil War. During the Battle of Karbala, Husayn ibn Ali and other descendants of Muhammad were massacred by Yazid; the event has been annually commemorated by Shia ever since. Sunnis, led by Ibn al-Zubayr, who were opposed to the caliphate turning into a dynasty were defeated in the Siege of Mecca. These disputes over leadership would give rise to the Sunni-Shia schism,[126] with the Shia believing leadership belonging to Ali and the family of Muhammad called the ahl al-bayt while the Kharijites disagreed with Uthman and Ali and quietist forms led to the emergence of the third largest denomination in Islam, Ibadiyya.\n",

Malik ibn Anas wrote one of the earliest books on Islamic jurisprudence, the Muwatta,[131] as a consensus of the opinion of those jurists.[132][133][134] The Kharijites believed there is no compromised middle ground between good and evil and any Muslim committing a grave sin becomes an unbeliever, with the term also used to refer to later groups such as Isis.[135] Conversely, an early sect, the Murji'ah taught that people's righteousness could be judged by God alone and that wrongdoers might be considered misguided but not denounced as unbelievers and this attitude came to prevail into the mainstream.\n",

While the Rashidun Caliphate emphasized austerity, with Umar even requiring an inventory of each official's possessions,[140] Umayyad luxury bred dissatisfaction among the pious. The Kharijites led the Berber Revolt leading to the first Muslim states independent of the Caliphate.

In the 9th century Al-Tabari completed the first commentary of the Quran, that became one of the most cited commentaries in Sunni Islam, the Tafsir al-Tabari.

Caliphs such as Mamun al Rashid and Al-Mu'tasim made it an official creed and unsuccessfully attempted to force their position on the majority. They carried out inquisitions with the traditionalist Ahmad ibn Hanbal notably refusing to conform to the Mutazila idea of the creation of the Quran and was tortured and kept in an unlit prison cell for nearly thirty months.[150] However, other schools of speculative theology – Māturīdism founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi and Ash'ari founded by Al-Ash'ari – were more successful in being widely adopted. Philosophers such as Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes sought to harmonize Aristotle's metaphysics within Islam, similar to later scholasticism within Christianity in Europe, while others like Al-Ghazali argued against such syncretism and ultimately prevailed.[151]\n",

According to Ottoman historiography, the legitimation of a ruler is attributed to Sheikh Edebali who interpreted a dream of Osman Gazi as God's legitimation of his reign.[197] The Mevlevi Order and Bektashi Order had a close relation to the sultans,[198] as Sufi-mystical as well as heterodox and syncretic approaches to Islam flourished.[199][200] The often forceful Safavid conversion of Iran to the Twelver Shia Islam of the Safavid dynasty ensured the final dominance of the Twelver sect within Shiism over the Ismaili sects and the Zaidi,[201] which had previously been the majority and oldest group among the Shia.[202][203][204] Nader Shah, who overthrew the Safavids, attempted to improve relations with Sunnis by propagating the integration of Twelverism into Sunni Islam as a fifth madhhab, called Ja'farism,[205] which failed to gain recognition from the Ottomans.[206]\n",

He called for a jihad against those he deemed heretics[208] but his writings only played a marginal role during his lifetime.[209] During the 18th century in Arabia, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, influenced by the works of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim, founded a movement, called Wahhabi with their self-designation as Muwahiddun, to return to what he saw as unadultered Islam.[210][211] He condemned many local Islamic customs, such as visiting the grave of Muhammad or saints, as later innovations and sinful[211] and destroyed sacred rocks and trees, Sufi shrines, the tombs of Muhammad and his companions and the tomb of Husayn at Karbala, a major Shiite pilgrimage site.[213] He formed an alliance with the Saud family, which, by the 1920s, completed their conquest of the area that would become Saudi Arabia.[214] Ma Wanfu and Ma Debao promoted salafist movements in the nineteenth century such as Sailaifengye in China after returning from Mecca but were eventually persecuted and forced into hiding by Sufi groups.[215] Other groups sought to reform Sufism rather than reject it, with the Senusiyya and Muhammad Ahmad both waging war and establishing states in Libya and Sudan respectively. In India, Shah Waliullah Dehlawi attempted a more conciliatory style against Sufism and influenced the Deobandi movement. In response to the Deobandi movement, the Barelwi movement was founded as a mass movement, defending popular Sufism and reforming its practices.[218][219] The movement is famous for the celebration of the Muhammad's birthday and today, is spread across the globe.[220]\n",

In contrast, later prominent Sufis, such as Mansur Al-Hallaj and Jalaluddin Rumi, emphasized religiosity based on love towards God.

Islam's sensual descriptions of paradise led many Christians to conclude that Islam was not a spiritual religion. Although sensual pleasure was also present in early Christianity, as seen in the writings of Irenaeus, the doctrines of the former Manichaean, Augustine of Hippo, led to the broad repudiation of bodily pleasure in both life and the afterlife. Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari defended the Quranic description of paradise by asserting that the Bible also implies such ideas, such as drinking wine in the Gospel of Matthew.[384]\n",

الاسلام, romanized: al-’Islām, [ɪsˈlaːm] ()) is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion whose central text, the Quran, is considered by followers, known as Muslims,[1] to be the word of God.', \"[2][3] It is the world's second-largest religion with more than two billion followers or 24.9% of the world's population.\", '[4][5] Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful and unique, and has guided humanity through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs, with the Quran as the final, universal revelation and Muhammad as the seal of the prophets,[3][7] while the teachings and practices of Muhammad documented in traditional accounts provide a secondary constitutional model for Muslims to follow.', '[8]\\n\\nMuslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.', '[9] Muslims consider the Quran, in Arabic, to be the unaltered and final revelation of God.', 'Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and the unrighteous punished in hell.', '[11] Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, as well as following Islamic law (sharia), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment.', '[13] The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.', '[14]\\n\\nFrom a historical point of view, Islam originated in early 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula, in Mecca.', '[15] and by the 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate extended from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus River in the east.', 'The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century, during the Abbasid Caliphate, when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, economic, and cultural flourishing.', '[16][17][18] The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates such as the Ottoman Empire, trade, and conversion to Islam by missionary activities (dawah).', '[19]\\n\\nMost Muslims are of one of two denominations: Sunni (85–90%)[20] or Shia (10–15%),[21][22] and make up a majority of the population in 49 countries.', '[24][25] Sunni and Shia differences arose from disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions.', '[26] About 12% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country;[27] 31% live in South Asia;[28] 20% in the Middle East–North Africa and 15% in sub-Saharan Africa.', '[29] Sizable Muslim communities can also be found in the Americas, China, and Europe.', '[30][31] Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.', '[32][33]\\n\\nEtymology\\n\\nIn Arabic, Islam (Arabic: إسلام lit.', \"'submission [to God]') is the verbal noun originating from the verb سلم (salama), from triliteral root س-ل-م (S-L-M), which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, sincerity, safeness, and peace.\", '[34] Islam is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root and means \"submission\" or \"total surrender\".', 'In a religious context, it means \"total surrender to the will of God\".', '[35] A Muslim (Arabic: مُسْلِم), the word for a follower of Islam, is the active participle of the same verb form, and means \"submitter (to God)\" or \"one who surrenders (to God)\".', 'The word \"Islam\" (\"submission\") sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran.', 'Some verses stress the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: \"Whoever God wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.', '\"[i]\\n\\nOthers describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.', '[ii] In the Hadith of Gabriel, Islam is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith), and ihsān (excellence).', '[38]\\n\\nThe word \"silm\" (Arabic: سِلْم) in Arabic means both peace and also the religion of Islam.', '[39] A common linguistic phrase demonstrating its usage is \"he entered into as-silm\" (Arabic: دَخَلَ فِي السِّلْمِ) which means \"he entered into Islam,\" with a connotation of finding peace by submitting one\\'s will to the Will of God.', '[39] The word \"Islam\" can be used in a linguistic sense of submission or in a technical sense of the religion of Islam, which also is called as-silm which means peace.', '[39]\\n\\nIslam itself was historically called Mohammedanism in the English-speaking world.', \"This term has fallen out of use and is sometimes said to be offensive, as it suggests that a human being, rather than God, is central to Muslims' religion, parallel to Buddha in Buddhism.\", '[40] Some authors, however, continue to use the term Mohammedanism as a technical term for the religious system as opposed to the theological concept of Islam that exists within that system.', 'Articles of faith\\n\\nThe Islamic creed (aqidah) requires belief in six articles: God, angels, books, prophets, the Day of Resurrection and in the divine decree.', 'God\\n\\nThe central concept of Islam is tawḥīd (Arabic:توحيد), the oneness of God.', 'Usually thought of as a precise monotheism, but also panentheistic in Islamic mystical teachings.', \"[41] God is seen as incomparable and without partners such as in the Christian Trinity,[42] and associating partners to God or attributing God's attributes to others is seen as idolatory, called shirk.\", 'God is seen as transcendent of creation and so is beyond comprehension.', 'Thus, therefore Muslims are not iconodules and do not attribute forms to God.', 'God is instead described and referred to by several names or attributes, the most common being Ar-Rahmān (الرحمان) meaning \"The Entirely Merciful,\" and Ar-Rahīm ( الرحيم) meaning \"The Especially Merciful\" which are invoked at the beginning of most chapters of the Quran.', '[43][44]\\n\\nIslam teaches that the creation of everything in the universe was brought into being by God\\'s command as expressed by the wording, \"Be, and it is,\"[iii][45] and that the purpose of existence is to worship God.', '[iv][46][47] He is viewed as a personal god[v][45] and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God.', 'Consciousness and awareness of God is referred to as Taqwa.', 'Allāh is a term with no plural or gender being ascribed to it and is also used by Muslims and Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews in reference to God, whereas ʾilāh (Arabic: إله) is a term used for a deity or a god in general.', '[48] Other non-Arab Muslims might use different names as much as Allah, for instance \"Tanrı\" in Turkish or \"Khodā\" in Persian.', 'Angels\\n\\nAngels (Arabic:ملك malak) are beings described in the Quran and hadith.', \"They are described as created to worship God and also to serve other specific duties such as communicating revelations from God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's soul at the time of death.\", \"They are described as being created variously from 'light' (nūr)[51] or 'fire' (nār)[52] Islamic angels are often represented in anthropomorphic forms combined with supernatural images, such as wings, being of great size or wearing heavenly articles.\", '[vi][54] Common characteristics for angels are their missing needs for bodily desires, such as eating and drinking.', 'Some of them, such as Gabriel and Michael, are mentioned by name in the Quran.', \"Angels play a significant role in the literature about the Mi'raj, where Muhammad encounters several angels during his journey through the heavens.\", 'Further angels have often been featured in Islamic eschatology, theology and philosophy.', 'Books\\n\\nAl-Fatiha (The Opening), is seven verses The first chapter of the Quran,), is seven verses\\n\\nThe Islamic holy books are the records that Muslims believe various prophets received from God through revelations, called wahy.', 'Muslims believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, such as the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel), had become distorted—either in interpretation, in text, or both,[57] while the Quran (lit.', '\"Recitation\")[58][59] is viewed as the final, verbatim and unaltered word of God.', 'Muslims believe that the verses of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad by God, through the archangel Gabriel (Jibrīl), on multiple occasions between 610 CE and 632, the year Muhammad died.', 'While Muhammad was alive, these revelations were written down by his companions, although the prime method of transmission was orally through memorization.', '[61] The Quran is divided into 114 chapters (suras) which combined contain 6,236 verses (āyāt).', 'The chronologically earlier chapters, revealed at Mecca, are concerned primarily with spiritual topics while the later Medinan chapters discuss more social and legal issues relevant to the Muslim community.', \"[45][58] Muslim jurists consult the hadith ('accounts'), or the written record of Prophet Muhammad's life, to both supplement the Quran and assist with its interpretation.\", 'The science of Quranic commentary and exegesis is known as tafsir.', '[62] The set of rules governing proper elocution of recitation is called tajwid.', 'In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature,[64][65] and has influenced art and the Arabic language.', '[66]\\n\\nProphets\\n\\nMoses, A Persian miniature depicts Muhammad leading Abraham Jesus and other prophets in prayer.', 'Prophets (Arabic: أنبياء, anbiyāʾ) are believed to have been chosen by God to receive and preach a divine message.', 'Additionally, a prophet delivering a new book to a nation is called a rasul (Arabic: رسول\\u200e, rasūl), meaning \"messenger\".', '[67] Muslims believe prophets are human and not divine.', 'All of the prophets are said to have preached the same basic message of Islam – submission to the will of God – to various nations in the past and that this accounts for many similarities among religions.', 'The Quran recounts the names of numerous figures considered prophets in Islam, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, among others.', '[45]\\n\\nMuslims believe that God sent Muhammad as the final prophet (\"Seal of the prophets\") to convey the completed message of Islam.', 'In Islam, the \"normative\" example of Muhammad\\'s life is called the sunnah (literally \"trodden path\").', \"Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's moral behaviors in their daily lives, and the Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Quran.\", '[68] This example is preserved in traditions known as hadith, which are accounts of his words, actions, and personal characteristics.', \"Hadith Qudsi is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as God's verbatim words quoted by Muhammad that are not part of the Quran.\", 'A hadith involves two elements: a chain of narrators, called sanad, and the actual wording, called matn.', 'There are various methodologies to classify the authenticity of hadiths, with the commonly used grading being: \"authentic\" or \"correct\" (صحيح, ṣaḥīḥ); \"good\", hasan (حسن, ḥasan); or \"weak\" (ضعيف, ḍaʻīf), among others.', 'The Kutub al-Sittah are a collection of six books, regarded as the most authentic reports in Sunnism.', 'Among them is Sahih al-Bukhari, often considered by Sunnis to be one of the most authentic sources after the Quran.', '[69][70] Another famous source of hadiths is known as The Four Books, which Shias consider as the most authentic hadith reference.', '[71][72][73]\\n\\nResurrection and judgment\\n\\nBelief in the \"Day of Resurrection\" or Yawm al-Qiyāmah (Arabic:يوم القيامة), is also crucial for Muslims.', 'It is believed that the time of Qiyāmah is preordained by God but unknown to man.', 'The Quran and the hadith, as well as in the commentaries of scholars, describe the trials and tribulations preceding and during the Qiyāmah.', 'The Quran emphasizes bodily resurrection, a break from the pre-Islamic Arabian understanding of death.', '[74]\\n\\nOn Yawm al-Qiyāmah (Arabic: يوم القيامة), Muslims believe all humankind will be judged by their good and bad deeds and consigned to Jannah (paradise) or Jahannam (hell).', 'The Quran in Surat al-Zalzalah describes this as: \"So whoever does an atom\\'s weight of good will see it.', 'And whoever does an atom\\'s weight of evil will see it.\"', 'The Quran lists several sins that can condemn a person to hell, such as disbelief in God (كفر, kufr), and dishonesty.', 'However, the Quran makes it clear that God will forgive the sins of those who repent if he wishes.', 'Good deeds, like charity, prayer, and compassion towards animals,[75] will be rewarded with entry to heaven.', 'Muslims view heaven as a place of joy and blessings, with Quranic references describing its features.', 'Mystical traditions in Islam place these heavenly delights in the context of an ecstatic awareness of God.', '[77] Yawm al-Qiyāmah is also identified in the Quran as Yawm ad-Dīn (Arabic:يوم الدين \"Day of Religion\");[vii] as-Sāʿah (Arabic:الساعة \"the Last Hour\");[viii] and al-Qāriʿah (Arabic:القارعة \"The Clatterer\");[ix]\\n\\nDivine predestination\\n\\nThe concept of divine decree and destiny in Islam (Arabic: القضاء والقدر, al-qadāʾ wa l-qadar) means that every matter, good or bad, is believed to have been decreed by God.', 'Al-qadar, meaning \"power\", derives from a root that means \"to measure\" or \"calculating\".', '[78][79] Muslims often express this belief in divine destiny with the phrase \"Insha-Allah\" meaning \"if God wills\" when speaking on future events.', '[80][81] In addition to loss, gain is also seen as a test of believers – whether they would still recognize that the gain originates only from God.', '[82]\\n\\nActs of worship\\n\\nThere are five obligatory acts of worship – the Shahada, the five daily prayers, the Zakat alms-giving, fasting during Ramadan and the Hajj pilgrimage – collectively known as \"The Pillars of Islam\" (Arkān al-Islām).', '[83] Apart from these, Muslims also perform other supplemental religious acts.', 'Testimony\\n\\nThe shahadah, is an oath declaring belief in Islam.', 'The expanded statement is \"ʾašhadu ʾal-lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu wa ʾašhadu ʾanna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh\" (أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأشهد أن محمداً رسول الله), or, \"I testify that there is no deity except God and I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God.', '\"[85] Islam is sometimes argued to have a very simple creed with the shahada being the premise for the rest of the religion.', 'Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the shahada in front of witnesses.', '[86][88]\\n\\nPrayer\\n\\nPrayer in Islam, called as-salah or aṣ-ṣalāt (Arabic: الصلاة), is seen as a personal communication with God and consists of repeating units called rakat that include bowing and prostrating to God.', 'Performing prayers five times a day is compulsory.', 'The prayers are recited in the Arabic language and consist of verses from the Quran.', \"[89] The prayers are done in direction of the Ka'bah.\", 'Salat requires ritual purity, which involves wudu (ritual wash) or occasionally, such as for new converts, ghusl (full body ritual wash).', 'The means used to signal the prayer time is a vocal call called the adhan.', 'A mosque is a place of worship for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name masjid.', 'Although the primary purpose of the mosque is to serve as a place of prayer, it is also important to the Muslim community as a place to meet and study with the Masjid an-Nabawi (\"Prophetic Mosque\") in Medina, Saudi Arabia, having also served as a shelter for the poor.', '[90] Minarets are towers used to chant the adhan.', '[91]\\n\\nCharity\\n\\nZakāt (Arabic: زكاة, zakāh) is a means of welfare in a Muslim society, characterized by the giving of a fixed portion (2.5% annually)[92] of accumulated wealth by those who can afford it to help the poor or needy, such as for freeing captives, those in debt, or for (stranded) travellers, and for those employed to collect zakat.', '[x][93] It is considered a religious obligation that the well-off owe to the needy because their wealth is seen as a \"trust from God\\'s bounty\" and is seen as a \"purification\" of one\\'s excess wealth.', 'Conservative estimates of annual zakat are that it amounts to 15 times global humanitarian aid contributions.', '[94] Sadaqah, as opposed to Zakat, is a much encouraged supererogatory charity.', '[95] A waqf is a perpetual charitable trust, which financed hospitals and schools in Muslim societies.', '[97][98]\\n\\nFasting\\n\\nIftar, is served traditionally with A fast-breaking feast, known as, is served traditionally with dates\\n\\nDuring the month of Ramadan, it is obligatory for Muslims to fast.', 'The Ramadan fast (Arabic: صوم, ṣawm) precludes food and drink, as well as other forms of consumption, such as smoking, and is performed from dawn to sunset.', \"The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God by restraining oneself for God's sake from what is otherwise permissible and to think of the needy.\", 'Certain groups are exempt, including pregnant women.', '[99][better source needed] In addition, there are other days when fasting is supererogatory.', 'Pilgrimage\\n\\nThe obligatory Islamic pilgrimage, called the \"ḥajj\" (Arabic: حج), is to be done at least once a lifetime by every Muslim with the means to do so during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah.', 'Rituals of the Hajj mostly imitate the story of the family of Abraham.', \"Pilgrims spend a day and a night on the plains of Mina, then a day praying and worshipping in the plain of Mount Arafat, then spending a night on the plain of Muzdalifah; then moving to Jamarat, symbolically stoning the Devil,[100] then going to the city of Mecca and walking seven times around the Kaaba, which Muslims believe Abraham built as a place of worship, then walking seven times between Mount Safa and Mount Marwah recounting the steps of Abraham's wife, Hagar, while she was looking for water for her baby Ishmael in the desert before Mecca developed into a settlement.\", '[101] All Muslim men should wear only two simple white unstitched pieces of cloth called ihram, intended to bring continuity through generations and uniformity among pilgrims despite class or origin.', '[102][103] Another form of pilgrimage, umrah, is supererogatory and can be undertaken at any time of the year.', 'Medina is also a site of Islamic pilgrimage and Jerusalem, the city of many Islamic prophets, contains the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which used to be the direction of prayer before Mecca.', 'Quranic recitation and memorization\\n\\nMuslim men reading the Quran\\n\\nMuslims recite and memorize the whole or parts of the Quran as acts of virtue.', 'Reciting the Quran with elocution (tajwid) has been described as an excellent act of worship.', 'Pious Muslims recite the whole Quran during the month of Ramadan.', 'In Muslim societies, any social program generally begins with the recitation of the Quran.', 'One who has memorized the whole Quran is called a hafiz (\"memorizer\") who, it is said, will be able to intercede for ten people on the Last Judgment Day.', 'Apart from this, almost every Muslim memorizes some portion of the Quran because they need to recite it during their prayers.', 'Supplication and remembrance\\n\\nSupplication to God, called in Arabic ad-duʿāʾ (Arabic: الدعاء IPA: [duˈʕæːʔ]) has its own etiquette such as raising hands as if begging or invoking with an extended index finger.', \"Remebrance of God (Arabic: ذكر, Dhikr') refers to phrases repeated referencing God.\", \"Commonly, this includes Tahmid, declaring praise be due to God (Arabic: الحمد لله, al-Ḥamdu lillāh) during prayer or when feeling thankful, Tasbih, declaring glory to God during prayer or when in awe of something and saying 'in the name of God' (Arabic: بسملة, basmalah) before starting an act such as eating.\", \"History\\n\\nA panoramic view of Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina Hejaz region, today's Saudi Arabia, the second most sacred Mosque in Islam\\n\\nMuhammad (610–632)\\n\\nBorn in Mecca in 571, Muhammad was orphaned early in life.\", 'New trade routes rapidly transformed Meccan society from a semi-bedouin society to a commercial urban society, leaving out weaker segments of society without protection.', 'He acquired the nickname \"trustworthy\" (Arabic: الامين), and was sought after as a bank to safeguard valuables and an impartial arbitrator.', 'Affected by the ills of society and after becoming financially secure through marrying his employer, the businesswoman Khadija, he began retreating to a cave to contemplate.', 'During the last 22 years of his life, beginning at age 40 in 610 CE, Muhammad reported receiving revelations from God, conveyed to him through the archangel Gabriel,[107][108] thus becoming the seal of the prophets sent to the mankind according to Islamic tradition.', '[109][107]\\n\\nDuring this time, while in Mecca, Muhammad preached first in secret and then in public, imploring them to abandon polytheism and worship one God.', 'Many early converts to Islam were women, the poor, foreigners, and slaves like the first muezzin Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi.', 'The Meccan elite profited from the pilgrimages to the idols of the Kaaba and felt Muhammad was destabilizing their social order by preaching about one God and that in the process he gave ideas to the poor and slaves.', '[110][111] Muhammad, who was accused of being a poet, a madman or possessed, presented the challenge of the Quran to imitate the like of the Quran in order to disprove him.', 'The Meccan authorities persecuted Muhammad and his followers, including a boycott and banishment of Muhammad and his clan to starve them into withdrawing their protection of him.', 'This resulted in the Migration to Abyssinia of some Muslims (to the Aksumite Empire).', 'After 12 years of the persecution of Muslims by the Meccans, Muhammad and his companions performed the Hijra (\"emigration\") in AD 622 to the city of Yathrib (current-day Medina).', 'There, with the Medinan converts (the Ansar) and the Meccan migrants (the Muhajirun), Muhammad in Medina established his political and religious authority.', 'The Constitution of Medina was signed,[b] by all the tribes of Medina agreeing to defend Medina from external threats and establishing among the Muslim, Jewish, Christian, and pagan communities religious freedoms and freedom to use their own laws, security of women and the role of Medina as a sacred place barred of weapons and violence.', 'Within a few years, two battles took place against the Meccan forces: first, the Battle of Badr in 624—a Muslim victory—and then a year later, when the Meccans returned to Medina, the Battle of Uhud, which ended inconclusively.', '[citation needed] The Arab tribes in the rest of

الاسلام, romanized: al-’Islām, [ɪsˈlaːm] ()) is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion whose central text, the Quran, is considered by followers, known as Muslims,[1] to be the word of God.', \"[2][3] It is the world's second-largest religion with more than two billion followers or 24.9% of the world's population.\", '[4][5] Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful and unique, and has guided humanity through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs, with the Quran as the final, universal revelation and Muhammad as the seal of the prophets,[3][7] while the teachings and practices of Muhammad documented in traditional accounts provide a secondary constitutional model for Muslims to follow.', '[8]\\n\\nMuslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.', '[9] Muslims consider the Quran, in Arabic, to be the unaltered and final revelation of God.', 'Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and the unrighteous punished in hell.', '[11] Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, as well as following Islamic law (sharia), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment.', '[13] The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.', '[14]\\n\\nFrom a historical point of view, Islam originated in early 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula, in Mecca.', '[15] and by the 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate extended from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus River in the east.', 'The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century, during the Abbasid Caliphate, when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, economic, and cultural flourishing.', '[16][17][18] The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates such as the Ottoman Empire, trade, and conversion to Islam by missionary activities (dawah).', '[19]\\n\\nMost Muslims are of one of two denominations: Sunni (85–90%)[20] or Shia (10–15%),[21][22] and make up a majority of the population in 49 countries.', '[24][25] Sunni and Shia differences arose from disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions.', '[26] About 12% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country;[27] 31% live in South Asia;[28] 20% in the Middle East–North Africa and 15% in sub-Saharan Africa.', '[29] Sizable Muslim communities can also be found in the Americas, China, and Europe.', '[30][31] Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.', '[32][33]\\n\\nEtymology\\n\\nIn Arabic, Islam (Arabic: إسلام lit.', \"'submission [to God]') is the verbal noun originating from the verb سلم (salama), from triliteral root س-ل-م (S-L-M), which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, sincerity, safeness, and peace.\", '[34] Islam is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root and means \"submission\" or \"total surrender\".', 'In a religious context, it means \"total surrender to the will of God\".', '[35] A Muslim (Arabic: مُسْلِم), the word for a follower of Islam, is the active participle of the same verb form, and means \"submitter (to God)\" or \"one who surrenders (to God)\".', 'The word \"Islam\" (\"submission\") sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran.', 'Some verses stress the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: \"Whoever God wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.', '\"[i]\\n\\nOthers describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.', '[ii] In the Hadith of Gabriel, Islam is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith), and ihsān (excellence).', '[38]\\n\\nThe word \"silm\" (Arabic: سِلْم) in Arabic means both peace and also the religion of Islam.', '[39] A common linguistic phrase demonstrating its usage is \"he entered into as-silm\" (Arabic: دَخَلَ فِي السِّلْمِ) which means \"he entered into Islam,\" with a connotation of finding peace by submitting one\\'s will to the Will of God.', '[39] The word \"Islam\" can be used in a linguistic sense of submission or in a technical sense of the religion of Islam, which also is called as-silm which means peace.', '[39]\\n\\nIslam itself was historically called Mohammedanism in the English-speaking world.', \"This term has fallen out of use and is sometimes said to be offensive, as it suggests that a human being, rather than God, is central to Muslims' religion, parallel to Buddha in Buddhism.\", '[40] Some authors, however, continue to use the term Mohammedanism as a technical term for the religious system as opposed to the theological concept of Islam that exists within that system.', 'Articles of faith\\n\\nThe Islamic creed (aqidah) requires belief in six articles: God, angels, books, prophets, the Day of Resurrection and in the divine decree.', 'God\\n\\nThe central concept of Islam is tawḥīd (Arabic:توحيد), the oneness of God.', 'Usually thought of as a precise monotheism, but also panentheistic in Islamic mystical teachings.', \"[41] God is seen as incomparable and without partners such as in the Christian Trinity,[42] and associating partners to God or attributing God's attributes to others is seen as idolatory, called shirk.\", 'God is seen as transcendent of creation and so is beyond comprehension.', 'Thus, therefore Muslims are not iconodules and do not attribute forms to God.', 'God is instead described and referred to by several names or attributes, the most common being Ar-Rahmān (الرحمان) meaning \"The Entirely Merciful,\" and Ar-Rahīm ( الرحيم) meaning \"The Especially Merciful\" which are invoked at the beginning of most chapters of the Quran.', '[43][44]\\n\\nIslam teaches that the creation of everything in the universe was brought into being by God\\'s command as expressed by the wording, \"Be, and it is,\"[iii][45] and that the purpose of existence is to worship God.', '[iv][46][47] He is viewed as a personal god[v][45] and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God.', 'Consciousness and awareness of God is referred to as Taqwa.', 'Allāh is a term with no plural or gender being ascribed to it and is also used by Muslims and Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews in reference to God, whereas ʾilāh (Arabic: إله) is a term used for a deity or a god in general.', '[48] Other non-Arab Muslims might use different names as much as Allah, for instance \"Tanrı\" in Turkish or \"Khodā\" in Persian.', 'Angels\\n\\nAngels (Arabic:ملك malak) are beings described in the Quran and hadith.', \"They are described as created to worship God and also to serve other specific duties such as communicating revelations from God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's soul at the time of death.\", \"They are described as being created variously from 'light' (nūr)[51] or 'fire' (nār)[52] Islamic angels are often represented in anthropomorphic forms combined with supernatural images, such as wings, being of great size or wearing heavenly articles.\", '[vi][54] Common characteristics for angels are their missing needs for bodily desires, such as eating and drinking.', 'Some of them, such as Gabriel and Michael, are mentioned by name in the Quran.', \"Angels play a significant role in the literature about the Mi'raj, where Muhammad encounters several angels during his journey through the heavens.\", 'Further angels have often been featured in Islamic eschatology, theology and philosophy.', 'Books\\n\\nAl-Fatiha (The Opening), is seven verses The first chapter of the Quran,), is seven verses\\n\\nThe Islamic holy books are the records that Muslims believe various prophets received from God through revelations, called wahy.', 'Muslims believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, such as the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel), had become distorted—either in interpretation, in text, or both,[57] while the Quran (lit.', '\"Recitation\")[58][59] is viewed as the final, verbatim and unaltered word of God.', 'Muslims believe that the verses of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad by God, through the archangel Gabriel (Jibrīl), on multiple occasions between 610 CE and 632, the year Muhammad died.', 'While Muhammad was alive, these revelations were written down by his companions, although the prime method of transmission was orally through memorization.', '[61] The Quran is divided into 114 chapters (suras) which combined contain 6,236 verses (āyāt).', 'The chronologically earlier chapters, revealed at Mecca, are concerned primarily with spiritual topics while the later Medinan chapters discuss more social and legal issues relevant to the Muslim community.', \"[45][58] Muslim jurists consult the hadith ('accounts'), or the written record of Prophet Muhammad's life, to both supplement the Quran and assist with its interpretation.\", 'The science of Quranic commentary and exegesis is known as tafsir.', '[62] The set of rules governing proper elocution of recitation is called tajwid.', 'In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature,[64][65] and has influenced art and the Arabic language.', '[66]\\n\\nProphets\\n\\nMoses, A Persian miniature depicts Muhammad leading Abraham Jesus and other prophets in prayer.', 'Prophets (Arabic: أنبياء, anbiyāʾ) are believed to have been chosen by God to receive and preach a divine message.', 'Additionally, a prophet delivering a new book to a nation is called a rasul (Arabic: رسول\\u200e, rasūl), meaning \"messenger\".', '[67] Muslims believe prophets are human and not divine.', 'All of the prophets are said to have preached the same basic message of Islam – submission to the will of God – to various nations in the past and that this accounts for many similarities among religions.', 'The Quran recounts the names of numerous figures considered prophets in Islam, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, among others.', '[45]\\n\\nMuslims believe that God sent Muhammad as the final prophet (\"Seal of the prophets\") to convey the completed message of Islam.', 'In Islam, the \"normative\" example of Muhammad\\'s life is called the sunnah (literally \"trodden path\").', \"Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's moral behaviors in their daily lives, and the Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Quran.\", '[68] This example is preserved in traditions known as hadith, which are accounts of his words, actions, and personal characteristics.', \"Hadith Qudsi is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as God's verbatim words quoted by Muhammad that are not part of the Quran.\", 'A hadith involves two elements: a chain of narrators, called sanad, and the actual wording, called matn.', 'There are various methodologies to classify the authenticity of hadiths, with the commonly used grading being: \"authentic\" or \"correct\" (صحيح, ṣaḥīḥ); \"good\", hasan (حسن, ḥasan); or \"weak\" (ضعيف, ḍaʻīf), among others.', 'The Kutub al-Sittah are a collection of six books, regarded as the most authentic reports in Sunnism.', 'Among them is Sahih al-Bukhari, often considered by Sunnis to be one of the most authentic sources after the Quran.', '[69][70] Another famous source of hadiths is known as The Four Books, which Shias consider as the most authentic hadith reference.', '[71][72][73]\\n\\nResurrection and judgment\\n\\nBelief in the \"Day of Resurrection\" or Yawm al-Qiyāmah (Arabic:يوم القيامة), is also crucial for Muslims.', 'It is believed that the time of Qiyāmah is preordained by God but unknown to man.', 'The Quran and the hadith, as well as in the commentaries of scholars, describe the trials and tribulations preceding and during the Qiyāmah.', 'The Quran emphasizes bodily resurrection, a break from the pre-Islamic Arabian understanding of death.', '[74]\\n\\nOn Yawm al-Qiyāmah (Arabic: يوم القيامة), Muslims believe all humankind will be judged by their good and bad deeds and consigned to Jannah (paradise) or Jahannam (hell).', 'The Quran in Surat al-Zalzalah describes this as: \"So whoever does an atom\\'s weight of good will see it.', 'And whoever does an atom\\'s weight of evil will see it.\"', 'The Quran lists several sins that can condemn a person to hell, such as disbelief in God (كفر, kufr), and dishonesty.', 'However, the Quran makes it clear that God will forgive the sins of those who repent if he wishes.', 'Good deeds, like charity, prayer, and compassion towards animals,[75] will be rewarded with entry to heaven.', 'Muslims view heaven as a place of joy and blessings, with Quranic references describing its features.', 'Mystical traditions in Islam place these heavenly delights in the context of an ecstatic awareness of God.', '[77] Yawm al-Qiyāmah is also identified in the Quran as Yawm ad-Dīn (Arabic:يوم الدين \"Day of Religion\");[vii] as-Sāʿah (Arabic:الساعة \"the Last Hour\");[viii] and al-Qāriʿah (Arabic:القارعة \"The Clatterer\");[ix]\\n\\nDivine predestination\\n\\nThe concept of divine decree and destiny in Islam (Arabic: القضاء والقدر, al-qadāʾ wa l-qadar) means that every matter, good or bad, is believed to have been decreed by God.', 'Al-qadar, meaning \"power\", derives from a root that means \"to measure\" or \"calculating\".', '[78][79] Muslims often express this belief in divine destiny with the phrase \"Insha-Allah\" meaning \"if God wills\" when speaking on future events.', '[80][81] In addition to loss, gain is also seen as a test of believers – whether they would still recognize that the gain originates only from God.', '[82]\\n\\nActs of worship\\n\\nThere are five obligatory acts of worship – the Shahada, the five daily prayers, the Zakat alms-giving, fasting during Ramadan and the Hajj pilgrimage – collectively known as \"The Pillars of Islam\" (Arkān al-Islām).', '[83] Apart from these, Muslims also perform other supplemental religious acts.', 'Testimony\\n\\nThe shahadah, is an oath declaring belief in Islam.', 'The expanded statement is \"ʾašhadu ʾal-lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu wa ʾašhadu ʾanna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh\" (أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأشهد أن محمداً رسول الله), or, \"I testify that there is no deity except God and I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God.', '\"[85] Islam is sometimes argued to have a very simple creed with the shahada being the premise for the rest of the religion.', 'Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the shahada in front of witnesses.', '[86][88]\\n\\nPrayer\\n\\nPrayer in Islam, called as-salah or aṣ-ṣalāt (Arabic: الصلاة), is seen as a personal communication with God and consists of repeating units called rakat that include bowing and prostrating to God.', 'Performing prayers five times a day is compulsory.', 'The prayers are recited in the Arabic language and consist of verses from the Quran.', \"[89] The prayers are done in direction of the Ka'bah.\", 'Salat requires ritual purity, which involves wudu (ritual wash) or occasionally, such as for new converts, ghusl (full body ritual wash).', 'The means used to signal the prayer time is a vocal call called the adhan.', 'A mosque is a place of worship for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name masjid.', 'Although the primary

considered trustworthy but most Ibadi hadiths are also found in standard Sunni collections and contemporary Ibadis often approve of the standard Sunni collections.', '[280]\\n\\nOther denominations\\n\\nNon-denominational Muslims\\n\\nNon-denominational Muslims is an umbrella term that has been used for and by Muslims who do not belong to or do not self-identify with a specific Islamic denomination.', '[292][293][294] Recent surveys report that large proportions of Muslims in some parts of the world self-identify as \"just Muslim\", although there is little published analysis available regarding the motivations underlying this response.', '[295][296][297] The Pew Research Center reports that respondents self-identifying as \"just Muslim\" make up a majority of Muslims in seven countries (and a plurality in three others), with the highest proportion in Kazakhstan at 74%.', 'At least one in five Muslims in at least 22 countries self-identify in this way.', '[298]\\n\\nMysticism\\n\\nSufism (Arabic: تصوف, tasawwuf), is a mystical-ascetic approach to Islam that seeks to find a direct personal experience of God.', 'Classical Sufi scholars defined Tasawwuf as \"a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God\", through \"intuitive and emotional faculties\" that one must be trained to use.', '[299][300] It is not a sect of Islam and its adherents belong to the various Muslim denominations.', 'Ismaili Shias, whose teachings root in Gnosticism and Neo-Platonism,[301] as well as by the Illuminationist and Isfahan schools of Islamic philosophy have developed mystical interpretations of Islam.', \"[302] Hasan al-Basri, the early Sufi ascetic often portrayed as one of the earliest Sufis,[303] emphasized fear of failing God's expectations of obedience.\", 'In contrast, later prominent Sufis, such as Mansur Al-Hallaj and Jalaluddin Rumi, emphasized religiosity based on love towards God.', 'Such devotion would also have an impact on the arts, with Jalaluddin Rumi (1207–1273), still one of the best selling poets in America,[304][305] writing his Persian poem Masnawi and the works of Hafez (1315–1390) are often considered the pinnacle of Persian poetry.', 'Sufis see tasawwuf as an inseparable part of Islam, just like the sharia.', 'Traditional Sufis, such as Bayazid Bastami, Jalaluddin Rumi, Haji Bektash Veli, Junaid Baghdadi, and Al-Ghazali, argued for Sufism as being based upon the tenets of Islam and the teachings of the prophet.', '[308] Historian Nile Green argued that Islam in the Medieval period, was more or less Sufism.', '[184](p77)(p24) Popular devotional practices such as the veneration of Sufi saints have been viewed as innovations from the original religion from followers of salafism, who have sometimes physically attacked Sufis, leading to a deterioration in Sufi–Salafi relations.', 'Sufi congregations form orders (tariqa) centered around a teacher (wali) who traces a spiritual chain back to Muhammad.', '[309] Sufis played an important role in the formation of Muslim societies through their missionary and educational activities.', '[144][310][311] Sufi influenced Ahle Sunnat movement or Barelvi movement defends Sufi practices and beliefs with over 200 million followers in south Asia.', '[312][313][314] Sufism is prominent in Central Asia,[315][316] as well as in African countries like Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Chad and Niger.', '[298][317]\\n\\nLaw and jurisprudence\\n\\nSharia is the religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition.', '[13] It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the Hadith.', \"In Arabic, the term sharīʿah refers to God's divine law and is contrasted with fiqh, which refers to its scholarly interpretations.\", '[318][319] The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.', '[13]\\n\\nTraditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources of sharia: the Quran, sunnah (Hadith and Sira), qiyas (analogical reasoning), and ijma (juridical consensus).', '[320] Different legal schools developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ijtihad.', '[318] Traditional jurisprudence distinguishes two principal branches of law,ʿibādāt (rituals) and muʿāmalāt (social relations), which together comprise a wide range of topics.', '[318] Its rulings assign actions to one of five categories called ahkam: mandatory (fard), recommended (mustahabb), permitted (mubah), abhorred (makruh), and prohibited (haram).', '[318][319] Forgiveness is much celebrated in Islam and, in criminal law, while imposing a penalty on an offender in proportion to their offense is considered permissible; forgiving the offender is better.', 'To go one step further by offering a favor to the offender is regarded as the peak of excellence.', \"[xi] Some areas of sharia overlap with the Western notion of law while others correspond more broadly to living life in accordance with God's will.\", '[319]\\n\\nHistorically, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists (muftis).', \"Their legal opinions (fatwa) were taken into account by ruler-appointed judges who presided over qāḍī's courts, and by maẓālim courts, which were controlled by the ruler's council and administered criminal law.\", '[318][319] In the modern era, sharia-based criminal laws were widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models.', \"[319] The Ottoman Empire's 19th-century Tanzimat reforms lead to the Mecelle civil code and represented the first attempt to codify sharia.\", '[323] While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in personal status (family) laws.', '[319] Legislative bodies which codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence.', '[319][324] The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought along calls by Islamist movements for complete implementation of sharia.', '[319][324] The role of sharia has become a contested topic around the world.', \"There are ongoing debates whether sharia is compatible with secular forms of government, human rights, freedom of thought, and women's rights.\", '[325][326][327]\\n\\nSchools of jurisprudence\\n\\nA school of jurisprudence is referred to as a madhhab (Arabic: مذهب).', \"The four major Sunni schools are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali madhahs while the three major Shia schools are the Ja'fari, Zaidi and Isma'ili madhahib.\", 'Each differs in their methodology, called Usul al-fiqh (\"principles of jurisprudence\").', \"The following of decisions by a religious expert without necessarily examining the decision's reasoning is called taqlid.\", 'The term ghair muqallid literally refers to those who do not use taqlid and, by extension, do not have a madhab.', '[328] The practice of an individual interpreting law with independent reasoning is called ijtihad.', 'Society\\n\\nReligious personages\\n\\nIslam, like Judaism, has no clergy in the sacerdotal sense, such as priests who mediate between God and people.', 'Imam (إمام) is the religious title used for the individual who leads an Islamic worship service.', 'Religious interpretation is presided over by the ‘ulama (Arabic: علماء), a term used describe the body of Muslim scholars who have received training in Islamic studies.', 'A scholar of the hadith is called a muhaddith, a scholar of jurisprudence is called a faqih (فقيه), a jurist who is qualified to issue legal opinions or fatwas is called a mufti, and a qadi is an Islamic judge.', 'Honorific titles given to scholars include sheikh, mullah and mawlawi.', 'Some Muslims also venerate saints associated with miracles (Arabic:كرامات, karāmāt).', 'The practice of visiting the tombs of prophets and saints is known as ziyarat.', 'Unlike saints in Christianity, Muslim saints are usually acknowledged informally by the consensus of common people, not by scholars.', 'Governance\\n\\nMainstream Islamic law does not distinguish between \"matters of church\" and \"matters of state\"; the scholars function as both jurists and theologians.', 'Various forms of Islamic jurisprudence therefore rule on matters than in other societal context might be considered the preserve of the state.', 'Terms traditionally used to refer to Muslim leaders include Caliph and Sultan and terms associated with traditionally Muslim states include Caliphate, Emirate, Imamate and Khanate.', 'In Islamic economic jurisprudence, hoarding of wealth is reviled and thus monopolistic behavior is frowned upon.', '[330] Attempts to comply with shariah has led to the development of Islamic banking.', 'Islam prohibits riba, usually translated as usury, which refers to any unfair gain in trade and is most commonly used to mean interest.', '[331] Instead, Islamic banks go into partnership with the borrower and both share from the profits and any losses from the venture.', 'Another feature is the avoidance of uncertainty, which is seen as gambling[332] and Islamic banks traditionally avoid derivative instruments such as futures or options which substantially protected them from the 2008 financial crisis.', '[333] The state used to be involved in distribution of charity from the treasury, known as Bayt al-mal, before it became a largely individual pursuit.', 'The first Caliph, Abu Bakr, distributed zakat as one of the first examples of a guaranteed minimum income, with each man, woman and child getting 10 to 20 dirhams annually.', '[334] During the reign of the second Caliph Umar, child support was introduced and the old and disabled were entitled to stipends,[335][336][337] while the Umayyad Caliph Umar II assigned a servant for each blind person and for every two chronically ill persons.', '[338]\\n\\nJihad means \"to strive or struggle [in the way of God]\" and, in its broadest sense, is \"exerting one\\'s utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation\".', 'This could refer to one\\'s striving to attain religious and moral perfection[340][341] with the Shia and Sufis in particular, distinguishing between the \"greater jihad\", which pertains to spiritual self-perfection, and the \"lesser jihad\", defined as warfare.', '[343] When used without a qualifier, jihad is often understood in its military form.', '[340] Jihad is the only form of warfare permissible in Islamic law and may be declared against illegal works, terrorists, criminal groups, rebels, apostates, and leaders or states who oppress Muslims.', '[343] Most Muslims today interpret Jihad as only a defensive form of warfare.', '[344] Jihad only becomes an individual duty for those vested with authority.', 'For the rest of the populace, this happens only in the case of a general mobilization.', \"[343] For most Twelver Shias, offensive jihad can only be declared by a divinely appointed leader of the Muslim community, and as such, is suspended since Muhammad al-Mahdi's occultation is 868 AD.\", 'Daily and family life\\n\\nMany daily practices fall in the category of adab, or Islamic etiquette.', 'As a religion, Islam emphasizes the idea of having a good character as Muhammad said: \"The best among you are those who have the best manners and character.', '\"[xii] This includes greeting others with \"as-salamu \\'alaykum\" (\"peace be unto you\"), saying bismillah (\"in the name of God\") before meals, and using only the right hand for eating and drinking.', 'Specific prohibited foods include pork products, blood and carrion.', 'Health is viewed as a trust from God and intoxicants, such as alcoholic drinks, are prohibited.', '[347] All meat must come from a herbivorous animal slaughtered in the name of God by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian, except for game that one has hunted or fished for themself.', '[348] Beards are often encouraged among men as something natural[349][350] and body modifications, such as permanent tattoos, are usually forbidden as violating the creation.', '[f][352] Gold and silk for men are prohibited and are seen as extravagant.', '[353] Haya, often translated as \"shame\" or \"modesty\", is sometimes described as the innate character of Islam[354] and informs much of Muslim daily life.', 'For example, clothing in Islam emphasizes a standard of modesty, which has included the hijab for women.', 'Similarly, personal hygiene is encouraged with certain requirements.', 'In Islamic marriage, the groom is required pay a bridal gift (mahr).', '[355] Most families in the Islamic world are monogamous.', '[356][357] However, Muslim men are allowed to practice polygyny and can have up to four wives at the same time.', 'There are also cultural variations in weddings.', '[358] Polyandry, a practice wherein a woman takes on two or more husbands, is prohibited in Islam.', '[359]\\n\\nAfter the birth of a child, the Adhan is pronounced in the right ear.', 'On the seventh day, the aqiqah ceremony is performed, in which an animal is sacrificed and its meat is distributed among the poor.', \"The child's head is shaved, and an amount of money equaling the weight of its hair is donated to the poor.\", 'Male circumcision is practised.', \"Respecting and obeying one's parents, and taking care of them especially in their old age is a religious obligation.\", '[363]\\n\\nA dying Muslim is encouraged to pronounce the Shahada as their last words.', 'Paying respects to the dead and attending funerals in the community are considered among the virtuous acts.', 'In Islamic burial rituals, burial is encouraged as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours.', 'The body is washed, except for martyrs, by members of the same gender and enshrouded in a garment that must not be elaborate called kafan.', 'A \"funeral prayer\" called Salat al-Janazah is performed.', 'Wailing is discouraged.', 'Coffins are often not preferred and graves are often unmarked, even for kings.', \"[365] Regarding inheritance, a son's share is double that of a daughter's.\", '[xiii]\\n\\nArts and culture\\n\\nThe term \"Islamic culture\" can be used to mean aspects of culture that pertain to the religion, such as festivals and dress code.', 'It is also controversially used to denote the cultural aspects of traditionally Muslim people.', '[366] Finally, \"Islamic civilization\" may also refer to the aspects of the synthesized culture of the early Caliphates, including that of non-Muslims, sometimes referred to as \"Islamicate\".', 'Islamic art encompasses the visual arts including fields as varied as architecture, calligraphy, painting, and ceramics, among others.', '[368] While the making of images of animate beings has often been frowned upon in connection with laws against idolatry, this rule has been interpreted in different ways by different scholars and in different historical periods.', 'This stricture has been used to explain the prevalence of calligraphy, tessellation, and pattern as key aspects of Islamic artistic culture.', '[369] In Islamic architecture, varying cultures show influence such as North African and Spanish Islamic architecture such as the Great Mosque of Kairouan containing marble and porphyry columns from Roman and Byzantine buildings,[370] while mosques in Indonesia often have multi-tiered roofs from local Javanese styles.', \"The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar that begins with the Hijra of 622 CE, a date that was reportedly chosen by Caliph Umar as it was an important turning point in Muhammad's fortunes.\", '[371] Islamic holy days fall on fixed dates of the lunar calendar, meaning they occur in different seasons in different years in the Gregorian calendar.', 'The most important Islamic festivals are Eid al-Fitr (Arabic|عيد الف) on the 1st of Shawwal, marking the end of the fasting month Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha (Arabic|عيد الأضحى) on the 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah, coinciding with the end of the Hajj (pilgrimage).', '[372]\\n\\nDerived religions\\n\\nSome movements, such as the Druze,[373][374][375][376][377] Berghouata and Ha-Mim, either emerged from Islam or came to share certain beliefs with Islam, and whether each is a separate religion or a sect of Islam is sometimes controversial.', 'Yazdânism is seen as a blend of local Kurdish beliefs and Islamic Sufi doctrine introduced to Kurdistan by Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir in the 12th century.', \"Bábism stems from Twelver Shia passed through Siyyid 'Ali Muhammad i-Shirazi al-Bab while one of his followers Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri Baha'u'llah founded the Baháʼí Faith.\", '[378] Sikhism, founded by Guru Nanak in late-fifteenth-century Punjab, incorporates aspects of both Islam and Hinduism.', \"[379]\\n\\nCriticism\\n\\nCriticism of Islam has existed since Islam's formative stages.\", 'Early criticism came from Christian authors, many of whom viewed Islam as a Christian heresy or a form of idolatry, often explaining it in apocalyptic terms.', 'Later, criticism from the Muslim world itself appeared, as well as from Jewish writers and from ecclesiastical Christians.', '[382][383]\\n\\nChristian writers criticized Islamic salvation optimism and its carnality.', \"Islam's sensual descriptions of paradise led many Christians to conclude that Islam was not a spiritual religion.\", 'Although sensual pleasure was also present in early Christianity, as seen in the writings of Irenaeus, the doctrines of the former Manichaean, Augustine of Hippo, led to the broad repudiation of bodily pleasure in both life and the afterlife.', 'Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari defended the Quranic description of paradise by asserting that the Bible also implies such ideas, such as drinking wine in the Gospel of Matthew.', '[384]\\n\\nDefamatory images of Muhammad, derived from early 7th century depictions of the Byzantine Church,[385] appear in the 14th-century epic poem
